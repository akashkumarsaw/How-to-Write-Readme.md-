## What is README.md File?
A README file is an essential guide that gives other developers a detailed description of your GitHub project.

You may be wondering, Why anyone should spend time writing a README file. Well, here are some reasons to help convince you that it’s a good idea:

- A good README helps your project to stand out from other projects and should be as good as your project itself.
- It’s the first thing to notice while encountering your project, so it should be pretty brief but detailed.
- The quality of a README description differentiates a good project from bad ones.
- Many times README.md is hosted as a website; make sure your webpage looks as cool as your project!
